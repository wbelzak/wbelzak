Currently, my research focuses on developing penalized methods for item response theory (IRT) and nonlinear factor analysis, particularly to improve the evaluation of measurement bias in latent variable modeling applications. I use regularization to solve common psychometric problems, such as identifying differential item functioning (DIF) across multiple background characteristics (e.g., gender, ethnicity, age, etc.).

In addition, I have developed a penalized Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to efficiently perform regularized differential item functioning in the R programming language. This is implemented in the regDIF package available for use at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=regDIF.

I am also interested in using crossed random effects models for item-by-person data.
