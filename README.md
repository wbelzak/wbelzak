I am currently a Senior Assessment Scientist at Duolingo working on the [Duolingo English Test](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/research).

I have a Ph.D. and M.A. in [Quantitative Psychology](https://quantpsych.unc.edu/) from UNC - Chapel Hill (2021, 2019; Advisor: [Dan Bauer](https://dbauer.web.unc.edu/)), an M.A. in [Psychology](https://www.wm.edu/as/psych-sciences/index.php) from the College of William & Mary (2017; Advisor: [Todd Thrash](https://www.wm.edu/as/psych-sciences/facultydirectory/thrash_t.php)), and a B.A. in Economics from N.C. State University (2013).

I am broadly interested in psychometrics and human assessment. While most of my research has focused on measurement bias and personality/motivation, more recently I've been working on test security, test and rater reliability, and individual differences in decision-making.

My research can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Lt-RGPwAAAAJ) and my professional history on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/williambelzak/). Feel free to reach out anytime at <wbelzak@gmail.com>.
