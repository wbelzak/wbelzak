I am currently a senior assessment scientist at Duolingo working on the [Duolingo English Test](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/research).

I received a Ph.D. and M.A. in [Quantitative Psychology](https://quantpsych.unc.edu/) from UNC - Chapel Hill in 2021 and 2019, respectively, advised by [Dan Bauer](https://dbauer.web.unc.edu/). Before that, I received an M.A. in Experimental Psychology from the College of William & Mary (2017), advised by [Todd Thrash](https://www.wm.edu/as/psych-sciences/facultydirectory/thrash_t.php), and a B.A. in Economics from N.C. State University (2013).

I am broadly interested in psychometrics and human assessment. While most of my research has focused on measurement bias and personality/motivation, more recently I've been working on test security, test and rater reliability, and individual differences in decision-making.

My research can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Lt-RGPwAAAAJ). Feel free to reach out anytime at <wbelzak@gmail.com>.
