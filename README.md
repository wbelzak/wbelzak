I work on validating the [Duolingo English Test](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/home), and I'm primarily interested in developing statistical methods to detect measurement bias in the social and behavioral sciences.

I received my Ph.D. in Quantitative Psychology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2021. I also received a Master's in Experimental Psychology from the College of William and Mary (2017) and a Bachelor's in Economics from North Carolina State University (2013).
