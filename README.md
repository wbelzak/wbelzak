I currently work on the [Duolingo English Test](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/research) using psychometric and statistical tools.

I received a Ph.D. in [Quantitative Psychology](https://quantpsych.unc.edu/) from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2021, as well as a Master's in Experimental Psychology from the College of William and Mary (2017) and a Bachelor's in Economics from North Carolina State University (2013).

I'm primarily interested in developing statistical and computational methods to detect measurement bias in the social and behavioral sciences. Check out my [R package](https://https://github.com/wbelzak/regDIF) using regularization and an expectation-maximization algorithm to detect measurement bias across multiple background variables (e.g., gender, race, age, etc.).

Here are links to my [CV](https://github.com/wbelzak/wbelzak/blob/master/static/BelzakCV_Aug2021.pdf) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Lt-RGPwAAAAJ) page.
