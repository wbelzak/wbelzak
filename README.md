I work on the [Duolingo English Test](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/home) using psychometric and statistical tools.

I received my Ph.D. in Quantitative Psychology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2021. I also received a Master's in Experimental Psychology from the College of William and Mary (2017) and a Bachelor's in Economics from North Carolina State University (2013).

I'm primarily interested in developing statistical and computational methods to detect measurement bias in the social and behavioral sciences. Check out my [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=regDIF) using regularization and an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to detect measurement bias across multiple background variables (e.g., gender, race, age, etc.).
