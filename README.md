I'm currently a senior assessment scientist at Duolingo working on the [Duolingo English Test](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/research).

I received a Ph.D. and M.A. in [Quantitative Psychology](https://quantpsych.unc.edu/) from UNC - Chapel Hill in 2021 and 2019, respectively, advised by [Dan Bauer](https://dbauer.web.unc.edu/). Before that, I received an M.A. in Experimental Psychology from the College of William & Mary (2017), advised by [Todd Thrash](https://www.wm.edu/as/psych-sciences/facultydirectory/thrash_t.php), and a B.A. in Economics from North Carolina State University (2013).

I'm broadly interested in psychometrics and human assessment. More specifcially, I've worked on measurement bias, test and rater reliability, personality and motivation, and test security.
