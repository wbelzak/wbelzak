I am currently a Senior Psychometrician at Duolingo.

I have a PhD and MA in [Quantitative Psychology from UNC - Chapel Hill](https://quantpsych.unc.edu/) (2021, 2019; Advisor: [Dan Bauer](https://dbauer.web.unc.edu/)), an MA in [Psychology from William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/as/psych-sciences/index.php) (2017; Advisor: [Todd Thrash](https://www.wm.edu/as/psych-sciences/facultydirectory/thrash_t.php)), and a BA in Economics from N.C. State (2013).

I am broadly interested in psychometrics and human assessment. While most of my research has focused on measurement bias and personality/motivation, I have more recently been working on test security, test and rater reliability, and individual differences in decision-making.
